# Parallel-Compute-Project
Temp description: Harvard CS205 Final Project

Brainstorming...
- Parallelize deep learning, other ML techniques on medical-related prediction (maybe diagnostics, imaging or other data)

-  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09941.pdf
-  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf
- Parallelizing k-means with OpenMP: https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/miller/Courses/CSE633/Chandramohan-Fall-2012-CSE633.pdf
-   Kmeans (or weighted) for cell type classification with RNA-Seq data would be interesting

Vague ideas:
- There's quite a lot of genomics data available, could be interesting to see if we can do some classification on this i.e. whether the individuals have certain medical conditions
- Off-topic but there have been some intereting publications of watermarking of audio files. The process is notoriously slow and some speed up is achieved through randomised SVD but could lend itself very well to this project

Q for TA: 
- Novelty
- Programming language
