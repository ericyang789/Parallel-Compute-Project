# Parallel-Compute-Project
Temp description: Harvard CS205 Final Project

Brainstorming...
- Parallelize deep learning, other ML techniques on medical-related prediction (maybe diagnostics, imaging or other data)

- Parallelizing k-means with OpenMP: https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/miller/Courses/CSE633/Chandramohan-Fall-2012-CSE633.pdf
-   Kmeans (or weighted) for cell type classification with RNA-Seq data would be interesting
